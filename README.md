# AI-Tattoo-Try-On
This is a public unity AR game 

**About the project**

This is a complete, finished, and released IOS game. I used ARKit to display AI-generated tattoos on faces realistically.

**Text-To-Image API**

I utilized stability.ai's Text-To-Image REST API to get a user prompt and used stable diffusion to create a tattoo.

**Shader graphs**

To position, resize, and enhance the AI images, I created a shader that transforms the UVs according to inputs and cuts out white segments.
